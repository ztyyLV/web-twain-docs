# Upgrade

This upgrade section talks about how to upgrade Dynamic Web TWAIN to a newer version. 

## How to upgrade

You can follow the steps below to upgrade Dynamic Web TWAIN:

1. Back up your current copy of `dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js`.

2. On your development machine, uninstall the old version of Dynamic Web TWAIN and install the new one.

3. Get the new **Resources** folder under the installation folder of Dynamic Web TWAIN and update the folder in your application. Use your original `dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js` if you want to keep the old settings. 

    Typical paths of Dynamic Web TWAIN folder:

   * **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Dynamsoft\Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK {Version Number}\`
   * **macOS**: `Applications > Dynamsoft > Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK {Version Number}`

4. Make necessary updates to the related code.

    If you get a new **license key** for the new version, you may follow the steps in [License]({{site.about}}license.html) to update it.
 
    For changes in the new version, you can check the [Release Notes]({{site.info}}schedule/stable.html) and [Deprecations]({{site.info}}schedule/deprecated.html).

    > Note: Please be aware of the following namespace changes introduced in v17.0:

    > | v17.0+ |v16.2- |
    > |:-|:-|
    > |`Dynamsoft.DWT` |`Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv`|
    > |`Dynamsoft.DWT.EnumDWT_` |`Dynamsoft.EnumDWT_`|
    > |`Dynamsoft.DBR.EnumBarcodeFormat` |`Dynamsoft.EnumBarcodeFormat`|

5. Deploy the new version files to your server and test. 

For Dynamic Web TWAIN v16.0 and later, Dynamsoft Service is designed to be backward compatible. Once you upgrade Dynamic Web TWAIN for your application on the server side, for **end-users' side**

- If the end-users have installed the same version or newer minor versions of Dynamsoft Service, they don't need to do anything;
- If the end-users have never installed Dynamsoft Service, or have an older version or a different newer major version of it, they will be required to do a reinstallation of Dynamsoft Service. The process is described <a href="{{site.indepth}}deployment/service.html#installation-of-dynamsoft-service">here</a>  

## Update `dwt` package

If your application uses a framework or library like Angular, React, Vue, etc. and uses the `dwt` package, you can just install the new version of Dynamic Web TWAIN to replace the old one and update the types definition as well. For example:

For npm:

``` cmd
npm install dwt
```

``` cmd
npm install @types/dwt
```

For Yarn:

``` cmd
yarn add dwt
```

``` cmd
yarn add @types/dwt
```
