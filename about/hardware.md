# Imaging Hardware 

Dynamic Web TWAIN's main feature is interacting with imaging devices like scanners and cameras. In this section, we'll look at the supported devices.

- [TWAIN Scanners](#twain-scanners)
- [ICA Scanners](#ica-scanners)
- [SANE Scanners](#sane-scanners)
- [DirectShow Cameras](#directshow-cameras)
- [MediaDevices Cameras](#mediadevices-cameras)

## TWAIN Scanners

`TWAIN Scanners` refer to image scanners and document scanners that have drivers following the TWAIN standard.

### Facts about TWAIN

* TWAIN is an application programming interface (API) and communication protocol that regulate communication between software and digital imaging devices, such as image scanners and digital cameras. 

* TWAIN is supported on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS X. However, based on our experience and the experience of many customers, TWAIN only works well on Windows. On Linux, [SANE](#sane-scanners) is the better and preferred alternative; on macOS, [ICA](#ica-scanners) is the better and preferred alternative.

* TWAIN is actively maintained by the non-profit [TWAIN Working Group](https://www.twain.org/). Members of the group consist of scanner vendors and imaging software vendors, including FUJITSU, Panasonic, Epson, HP, ExactCODE, LEADTOOLS, and of course, Dynamsoft.

* TWAIN is [the most commonly used protocol](https://www.twain.org/why-twain/) for image capturing and processing. Almost all scanners on the market come with a TWAIN driver and are supported by TWAIN applications like `Dynamic Web TWAIN`.

## ICA Scanners

`ICA Scanners` refer to image scanners that have drivers designed in accordance with the [ImageCaptureCore Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imagecapturecore).

### Facts about ICA

* ICA is a framework from Apple designed to "Browse for media devices and control them programmatically from your app."

* ICA is supported on macOS X.

## SANE Scanners

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-3]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-3.png)

`SANE Scanners` refer to image scanners that have drivers designed in accordance with the [SANE API](http://www.sane-project.org/).

### Facts about SANE

* SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any raster image scanner hardware.

* SANE is supported on multiple Linux distributions.

* As of version 16.1.1, `Dynamic Web TWAIN` supports SANE v1.0.25.

## DirectShow Cameras

![Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-4]({{site.assets}}imgs/Hardware-Scanners-Cameras-4.png)

`DirectShow Cameras` refer to the cameras which can be accessed via the [Microsoft DirectShow architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directshow/introduction-to-directshow). These cameras are either built into desktops / laptops or connected via USB.

## MediaDevices Cameras

`MediaDevices Cameras` refers to the cameras accessible via the [MediaDevices interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices). These cameras are either built into desktops/laptops/mobile devices, including phones and tablets, or connected via USB.

> `DirectShow Cameras` and `MediaDevices Cameras` could refer to the same devices which can be accessed either way.
