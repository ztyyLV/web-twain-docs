# Professional Service

Dynamsoft is devoted to making products as user-friendly as possible. In most cases, developers should be able to get started with the `Dynamic Web TWAIN` library in a very short time and integrate it into the workflow of their applications successfully within a matter of days. If any issues are met during the development process, the [Dynamsoft Support Team]({{site.about}}getsupport.html) is always ready to help.

In some cases, we realize that some customers may require more advanced support from Dynamsoft and that's why we also provide a paid professional service. We offer two types of this paid professional service, applicable to different scenarios.

## Virtual Developer Service

Although most of our customers have their own development teams (some are developers themselves) and can build their applications with the help of `Dynamic Web TWAIN` documentation and guides, there are still some customers who come to us for ready-made solutions. In other words, they would rather get a sample application that already has the required features than study the details of the SDK itself. In view of this, Dynamsoft provides a professional service called "Virtual Developer Service" (VDS). The idea is that Dynamsoft designates a team to help with the integration of `Dynamic Web TWAIN` into customers' applications, from requirements analysis to successful deployment.

The following is how VDS works

* Step 1: The customer sends over their requirements and other materials if required
* Step 2: Dynamsoft analyzes the requirements and decide whether `Dynamic Web TWAIN` meets them

> This step usually involves communicating back and forth until the requirements are clear enough and you can decide whether to proceed.

* Step 3: Dynamsoft sends a quotation for the service as well as a quotation for the required licenses
* Step 4: The customer makes the payment
* Step 5: Dynamsoft designates a team to the project. The team usually consists of a case manager, a developer and a tester
* Step 6: The designated team finishes the project before the agreed deadline and continues to maintain it during the agreed maintenance period

## Customization Service

Dynamsoft provides many public samples and code snippets free of cost to all customers. The code in these materials can be customized at will. However, the [resources files]({{site.about}}faqs.html#what-are-the-resources-files) provided with each SDK **should not be changed** unless otherwise mentioned in this documentation. If you want to make unmentioned changes to any of these files in the documentation, you must first consult [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html) to learn whether or not it can be done and if so, what that would entail from our end. If it involves a considerable amount of extra effort from the Dynamsoft team, the "Customization Service" (CS) may apply.

The difference between VDS and CS is that the latter involves changes to the `Dynamic Web TWAIN` SDK itself and is considered much more complicated from a technical standpoint. However, in term of the customer's workflow to get a customization job done, the steps are the same as VDS.

If you are interested in this type of professional service, please contact [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html).
