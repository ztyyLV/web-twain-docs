# How can I use Dynamic Web TWAIN in a Citrix environment?

If too many end-users access the same scanning application using the same communication port, it can slow down server response and increase wait time.

To optimize user experience within the Citrix environment, Dynamsoft offers the enhanced mode which distributes end-users among different ports. For more information, please check here: <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/blog/insights/document-scanning-within-citrix/" target="_blank">Optimized Document Scanning Within Citrix Remote Desktop</a>

To configure the enhanced mode, please follow the steps below:

1. Stop Dynamsoft Service
2. Set EnableEnhancedMode=TRUE in DSConfiguration.ini which is under `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Dynamsoft\DynamsoftServicex64_17`
3. Set Dynamsoft.DWT.IfCheckDCP=true in dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js 
4. Restart Dynamsoft Service

***In this case, initializing the DWT object dynamically is not supported.***

<strong>How to check if Enhance mode is running</strong>

1. user_config.ini which is under `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Dynamsoft\DynamsoftServicex64_17` will list the ports that each user is listening on.
2. In Network, the DWT port included in the request URL should be 17000 and so on, not 18622 anymore
