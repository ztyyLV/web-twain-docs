# Error Troubleshooting

## A connection with the server could not be established

### Symptom

When attempting to upload images web server the upload fails and you receive the error message.

### Cause

The problem may occur when a connection with the server is not available.

### Resolution

- Check if the HTTP port you set in your code coincides with the port number you set on your web server. You can use the [HTTPPort]({{site.info}}api/WebTwain_IO.html#httpport) property to set the port number.
- Make sure the address of the server is available. To check this, you can ping the address from a client machine.

> Note:
> Both the machine name and the IP address of the server can be used for the HTTPUpload method.
