# Error Troubleshooting

## Error Message - Source has nothing to capture

### Symptom

For Linux client OS, if ErrorCode or ErrorString is called after scanning, it returns the error code "1029" or string "Source has nothing to capture". Though the error appears, the scanning process has finished successfully.

### Solution

It's a known issue in Linux OS. Since this error will not affect the scanning process, no further action is required. 

### Planning

The issue is planned to be fixed in version 18.0.
