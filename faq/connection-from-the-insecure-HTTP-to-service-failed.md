# Error Troubleshooting

## Error Message - The connection from the insecure (HTTP) web page to the local 'Dynamsoft Service' failed

### Symptom 

On Windows 7 x86, Win7 64 Enterprise (or any older Windows OS), you get an error message that says **"The connection from the insecure (HTTP) web page to the local 'Dynamsoft Service' failed.
