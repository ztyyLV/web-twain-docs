# Error Troubleshooting

## Uncaught ReferenceError - DVS is not defined

There is a non-existent variable referenced somewhere, usually because our resources have failed to load.

Please make sure the path to Resources folder is correct and that you can find \*.viewer.js under the src folder. If it does not exist, please manually copy the Dynamic Web TWAIN resources to that folder.

Please refer to this link for more details on server deployment <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/deployment/server.html" target="_blank">Dynamic Web TWAIN Deployment - Server Deployment</a>
