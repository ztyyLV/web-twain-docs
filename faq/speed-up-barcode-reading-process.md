## Is there any way to speed up the barcode reading process?

There are several runtime settings you can use to speed up the barcode reading process:

- Specify the Barcode Type(s) to Read
- Specify maximum barcode count
- Specify a scan Region
- Use the built-in mode 'speed'

For more details on runtime settings, please check <a href="{{site.indepth}}features/barcode.html#runtime-settings" target="_blank">here</a>.

In addition, the size of the image generated during the scanning process also impacts the reading performance. You can check your scanning settings to balance the image qualify and size.
