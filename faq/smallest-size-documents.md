# Document Saving

## How can I reduce the size of documents in PDF, TIFF or JPEG format?

There are a few things that you can try to reduce the size of a resulting file

- Scan in grayscale or black & white instead of RGB;

- Convert the images to grayscale or black & white before the save or upload call. Read more <a href="{{site.indepth}}features/edit.html#working-with-pixels-and-bit-depth" target="_blank">here</a>;

- Scan in a lower resolution;

- Convert the images to a lower resolution (DPI). Read more <a href="{{site.indepth}}features/edit.html#working-with-pixels-and-bit-depth" target="_blank">here</a>;

- [Optional] If the resulting file is in the JPEG format (.jpg) or is a TIF or PDF that is encoded by the JPEG standard, you can set <a href="{{site.info}}api/WebTwain_IO.html#jpegquality" target="_blank">JPEGQuality</a> to a lower value.

    Before setting the JPEGQuality, set the compression type to the JPEG standard as outlined below.

    Before saving the file,

    - Step 1:
        - If you saved in PDF format,
  
        ```javascript
        DWObject.Addon.PDF.Write.Setup({compression: Dynamsoft.DWT.EnumDWT_PDFCompressionType.PDF_JPEG});
        //or set DWObject.Addon.PDF.Write.Setup({compression: 5}); which is equivalent.


        //Note: if you are using this method, you need to include dynamsoft.webtwain.addon.pdf.js file into the program. For example:
        <script type="text/javascript" src="Resources/addon/dynamsoft.webtwain.addon.pdf.js"> </script>
        ```
  
        - If you saved in TIF format,
  
        ```javascript
        DWObject.TIFFCompressionType = Dynamsoft.DWT.EnumDWT_TIFFCompressionType.TIFF_JPEG;
        //or set DWObject.TIFFCompressionType = 7 which is equivalent.
        ```
    
        - If you saved in JPEG format, please jump to **Step 2** directly.
  

    - Step 2: 
        - set the <a href="{{site.info}}api/WebTwain_IO.html#jpegquality" target="_blank">JPEGQuality</a> to a lower value, for example:

        ```javascript
        DWObject.JPEGQuality = 20;
        ```
        
  **Note that black & white image cannot be saved in the JPEG format. To reduce the size, please convert the image to grayscale.**
