# Are admin rights required to install the end-user component?

Yes, the Dynamsoft Service installer is a `.msi` file which requires administrator rights. If your organization does not allow end users to have admin rights, you can contact [Dynamsoft Support]({{site.about}}getsupport.html) to get a special "Personal Installer" that does not require admin rights.

> NOTE
>
> Once the Dynamsoft Service is installed with admin rights, every user on that machine can use it. On the other hand, if it is installed with a "Personal Installer", only that specific user can use it.
