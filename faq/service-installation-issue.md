# Dynamsoft Service installation and uninstallation issue


### Symptom

The old version of Dynamsoft Service cannot be uninstalled successfully through the Control Panel, and the new version of Dynamsoft Service cannot be successfully installed by double-clicking, or the following error message appears during installation.

![service installation-1]({{site.assets}}imgs/service-installation-1.png)

### Cause

The current user account does not match the user account under C:\Users\{account}

In the screenshot below, the current user is owen_thinkpad_t480s, but in 'Command Prompt', the corresponding folder under the C:\Users is ThinkPad.

![service installation-2]({{site.assets}}imgs/service-installation-2.png)

When installing by double-clicking DynamsoftServiceSetup.msi or uninstalling via Control Panel, Dynamic Web TWAIN takes the current user's Temp directory:
C:\Users\owen_thinkpad_t480s\AppData\Local\Temp, because this path can't be found, the installation/uninstallation failed.

### Resolution

Run 'Command Prompt' as administrator, go to C:\WINDOWS\system32, then execute the following line to unsitall it:

``` shell
wmic product where name="Dynamsoft Service" call uninstall /nointeractive
```

```
