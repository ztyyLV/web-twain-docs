# What does the Dynamsoft Service do on the end-user machine?

Dynamsoft Service is required for the Desktop Service Edition of Dynamic Web TWAIN. It's a background system service that handles the communication between connected physical devices and the browser, as well as image processing, encoding, decoding, etc.

## Three processes

By default, there are three Dynamsoft Service processes running which use the same file `DynamsoftService.exe` but initiated with different arguments:

- The **main process** starts without any argument as follows:

  ``` cmd
  C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Dynamsoft\DynamsoftServicex64\DynamsoftService.exe
  ```

- Then there is a **monitor process** which is meant to monitor the main process and automatically start it in case it crashes. The monitor process starts like this:

  ``` cmd
  C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Dynamsoft\DynamsoftServicex64\DynamsoftService.exe -asmonitor Global\Dynamsoft_1.5.0_352325843_stop_service_event   Global\Dynamsoft_1.5.0_352325828_certcheck_event
  ```

- The last always-running process is meant to **support the SSL certificate specifically for the Firefox browser**:

  ``` cmd
  "-scan" "\\.\pipe\dynamsoftscan_15.0_70056_60" "0" "Global\ss352604281_61_70056" "0" "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Dynamsoft\DynamsoftServicex64\dwt_trial_15.0.0.0625.dll"
  ```

> Note: you may find another process named 'Dynamsoft Scanning New Module', which is a scan module. This process will start when you access an application integrated with Dynamic Web TWAIN, and will automatically stop when you close the application. 

> * On Windows, the service runs under the Local System account
> * On macOS, the service runs under the current user account
> * On Linux, the service runs under the root account 


## Files and folders in the service directory

There are multiple files and folders in the service directory. Taking Windows service (located at `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Dynamsoft\DynamsoftServicex64_16`) as an example, the content is as follows:

### For the Service

* `\cert\` : The certificates used for SSL connection. Check out <a href="{{site.faq}}change-dynamsoft-service-certificate.html" target="_blank">How to change the certificates</a>.
* `\dump\` : Dump files in case the service crashes.
* `\log\` : Log files for debugging purposes.
* `\upload\` : Temporary location for image data to be uploaded by the file uploader.
