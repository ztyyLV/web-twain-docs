# Image Viewer

## How can I resize the view of image (e.g. zoom in/out on an image)?

You can resize the view of the image by using the zoom property of the viewer. It will return or set the zoom factor, and then the current page will be enlarged or reduced. You can find <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/WebTwain_Viewer.html?ver=latest#zoom" target="_blank">here</a> a detail explanations of this property.
