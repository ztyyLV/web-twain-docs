# Addon

## Can I use the WebAssembly Edition of SDK to support webcams instead of using the Webcam Capture addon for Desktop Service Edition?

Yes. The WebAssembly Edition does not require installation of the local Dynamsoft Service. If the need is to capture documents from webcams or mobile cameras only, the WebAssembly Edition can be used.

> Note - that the WebAssembly Edition is not supported by the Internet Explorer browser.

Also, not all Dynamic Web TWAIN features are fully available in the WebAssembly Edition. For more details, please check <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/development/upgrade.html?ver=latest#expand-your-application-to-mobile-platforms" target="_blank">here</a>.

You will also need some advanced features of modern WASM browsers for the WebAssembly Edition. Please check <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/getstarted/platform.html?ver=latest#wasm-browsers" target="_blank">WASM browsers</a> for more information.
