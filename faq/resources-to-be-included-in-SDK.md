# What resources of the SDK should be included in my web application?

You can include all the files under the Resources folder, but not all are required.

Under the `\addon` folder, you do not need the files for add-ons which are not used by your web application.

Under the `\dist` folder, you can include the installers required per your OS requirements.

Under the `\src` folder, you do not need the wasm files if you are not using camera functionalities.
