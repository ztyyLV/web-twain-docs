# How can I change the reference path to the Dynamsoft's resources in my project?

<strong>Scenario: </strong> For customers who are using Dynamic Web TWAIN, to change the location of the 'Resources' folder, or to rename it, please following the steps below:

<strong>Steps:</strong> In the below example we will assume the original Resources folder is located at '<strong>../{Project Directory}/Resources</strong>', and you want to change it to '<strong>../{Project Directory}/Newfolder/ResourcesTest</strong>'.

Step 1. Please make sure the structure inside 'Resources' folder stay unchanged.

Step 2. Change the relative path in your page where you reference the js files, for example:

```javascript
<script src="Resources/dynamsoft.webtwain.initiate.js"></script>
// or your own operation js file
<script src="Scripts/DWTSample_BasicScan.js"></script>
<script src="Resources/dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js"></script>
```

Modify as below:

```javascript
<script src="Newfolder/ResourcesTest/dynamsoft.webtwain.initiate.js"></script>
// or your own operation js file
<script src="Scripts/DWTSample_BasicScan.js"></script>
<script src="Newfolder/ResourcesTest/dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js"></script>
```

Step 3. The same change needs to be done in *dynamsoft.webtwain.config.js* file. Add/uncomment the following line, then change 'Resources' (to 'New folder/ResourcesTest' as in this case):

```javascript
Dynamsoft.DWT.ResourcesPath = "Resources";
```

Modify as below:

```javascript
Dynamsoft.DWT.ResourcesPath = "Newfolder/ResourcesTest";
```
