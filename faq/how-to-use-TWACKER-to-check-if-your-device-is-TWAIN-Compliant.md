## How to use TWACKER to check if your device is TWAIN Compliant?

- [Recommended] Use the tool called `Twacker` which is developed by the [TWAIN Working Group](https://www.twain.org/)

  - Download and install

    > Please download the version of TWACKER that matches your driver architecture, not your operating system architecture. In most cases, this will be 32-bit.

    - [32-bit](https://download.dynamsoft.com/tool/Twack_32.msi)
    - [64-bit](https://download.dynamsoft.com/tool/Twack_64.msi)

  - Open the program

- Select your device

> If your device is not listed, please check if the driver is installed. Or, try running `Twacker` as admin to see if it shows up.

- Choose the settings and click the Acquire to start scanning

> If scanning is successful without any errors, then your device should be TWAIN compliant. You can also try other commands to see how it works. If your scanner doesn't work with `TWACKER` , please check your scanner model online and make sure you have installed the (latest) TWAIN driver from its manufacturer.
