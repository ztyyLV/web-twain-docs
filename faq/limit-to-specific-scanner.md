## How can I limit all users to use a specific scanner model?

You can limit all the users to use a specific scanner model by automatically selecting that scanner programmatically. Use the method <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/info/api/WebTwain_Acquire.html?ver=latest#selectsourcebyindex" target="_blank">SelectSourceByIndex()</a> to select a scanner by its index in the source list. In some cases, you may want to select a source by its name as shown in the example below. This way you can use the specific scanner model.

```javascript
var sources = DWObject.GetSourceNames();
sources.find(function (name, index) {
  //"EPSON DS-530" is the name of the scanner
  if (name === "EPSON DS-530") DWObject.SelectSourceByIndex(index);
});
```
