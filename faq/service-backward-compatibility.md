# Running two different websites integrated with two different versions of Dynamic Web TWAIN on the same computer

Dynamic Web TWAIN has limited backward compatibility between different versions and only one version is expected to be used on an end-user's computer.

However, as Dynamic Web TWAIN is a popular document scanning SDK and has been integrated to many web applications all over the world. It is not uncommon that some end users use two different websites (developed by two different vendors) integrated with different versions of Dynamic Web TWAIN on the same computer.

As a result, we have provided the following instructions for backward compatibility between **version 17.1.1** and some of the older versions, in order to support running both versions on the same computer.

NOTE:
* The instructions below also apply to all future versions after version 17.1.1.
* There is a known issue for versions 17.2 and 17.2.*,  please use version 17.1.1 as a workaround. This issue has been fixed since version 17.3.

### Compatibility with version 17 minor versions

Version 17.1.1 is compatible with other minor versions: 17.1 and 17.0.
