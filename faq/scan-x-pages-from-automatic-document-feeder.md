## Can I set my document scanner to scan x number of pages instead of all pages from the automatic document feeder (ADF)?

Yes. You can use <a href="{{site.info}}api/WebTwain_Acquire.html#xfercount" target="_blank">XferCount</a> to set the number of pages you'd like to scan from the feeder at a time. However, please note that the XferCount API is a hardware-dependent feature, so it only works properly if your scanner device supports it.
