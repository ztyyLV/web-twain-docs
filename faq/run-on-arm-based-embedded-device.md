## Can I run the scanning service on an ARM-based embedded device, such as Raspberry Pi?

Starting from version 17.0, we provide an ARM64 version of the Dynamsoft Service. It can be found in the SDK package (Normally under C:\Program Files (x86)\Dynamsoft\Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK 17.1.1\Resources\dist) of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK from <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/downloads/" target="_blank">Download Center</a>.

So for any ARM64 based devices running on Linux OS, such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, you can also scan documents from physical scanners to the device's browser clients.

MIPS 64-bit version of the Dynamsoft Service is also available in the SDK package, if you need to support any MIPS devices.
