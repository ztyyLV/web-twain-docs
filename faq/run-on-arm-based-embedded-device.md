## Can I run the scanning service on an ARM-based embedded device, such as Raspberry Pi?

### Reason

Starting from version 17.0, we provide a ARM64 version of the Dynamsoft Service. It can be found in the SDK package of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK. >> <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/downloads/" target="_blank"> Download Center</a>.

So for any ARM64 based devices running on Linux OS, such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, you can also scan documents from physical scanners to the device’s browser clients.

MIPS 64-bit version of the Dynamsoft Service is also available in the SDK package, if you need to support any MIPS devices.
