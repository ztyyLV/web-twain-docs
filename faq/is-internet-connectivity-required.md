# Licensing and Purchase

## Is internet connectivity required to use all licenses?

No it is not mandatory, but different licensing options leverage different techniques.
Generally, you need to use a license server program to distribute your purchased license seats to specified devices.

Option #1: Connect to a license server hosted by Dynamsoft
- Dynamsoft has the license server hosted on Amazon's AWS. If your device can connect to the internet, you can easily license your devices this way. <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-tracking/docs/dshosting/index.html" target="_blank">More Detail ></a>

Option #2: Host the license server program on your own server machine
- By hosting the license server internally, all your devices can get licensed via your intranet. This is suggested if you don't allow internet connection of your devices. <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-tracking/docs/selfhosting/index.html" target="_blank">More Detail ></a>

Option #3: Discuss custom licensing with Dynamsoft
- If neither of the above options is desired, we can also provide a non-tracking offline license with a trust-based agreement signed by both parties. Please <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a> to discuss it.
