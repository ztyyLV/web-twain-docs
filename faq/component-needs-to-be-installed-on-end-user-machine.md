# Project Deployment and End-user Installation

## Is there any component of the Dynamic Web TWAIN SDK that needs to be installed on end-user machines?

For the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/features/initialize.html?ver=latest#desktop-service-edition" target="_blank">Desktop Service Edition</a>, the Dynamsoft Service needs to be installed on end-user machines. By default end-users will be prompted to install Dynamsoft Service when they access your application for the first time.

When you upgrade Dynamic Web TWAIN, you may also need a reinstallation of Dynamsoft Service on the client-side. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/development/upgrade.html?ver=latest#update-dynamsoft-service-on-the-client-side" target="_blank">Update Dynamsoft Service on the Client-side</a>.

If you do not want to install anything, there are two options.
1. You can choose the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/indepth/features/initialize.html?ver=latest#webassembly-edition" target="_blank">WebAssembly Edition</a>, but please note that the WebAssembly Edition does not support physical document scanners.
2. You can enable Remote Scan, which scans documents from remote scanners connected to host machines. No installation is required on the client machine. Please check <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/docs/faq/how-to-enable-remote-scan.html?ver=latest" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on how remote scan works and how to enable it.
